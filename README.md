# BooksDjangoAPI
This is a Django project in which we will implement a REST API that calls an external API service to get information about books. Additionally, we will implement a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API with a local database. The external API that will be used here is the Ice And Fire API. This API requires no sign up/authentication.
